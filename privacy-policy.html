               <h4>Data Protection & Privacy Principle</h4>

It shall be a fundamental principle with RMS Money Exchange that any Personal Data shall be processed fairly, sensitively, respectfully and in accordance with this Policy and applicable local law.</p>

                <p class="mt-2">3.Onward Transfer: RMS Money Exchange will ensure that all transfers of Personal Data, whether within or outside of the RMS Money Exchange group, are protected by suitable safeguards and in accordance with applicable local law. Further, unless required by court or another legal mandate, or except as discussed below, Personal Data will only be transferred outside of RMS Money Exchange if the receiving party has entered into a Data Protection Agreement with RMS Money Exchange or comparable safeguards are in place. Where Personal Data is transferred outside of RMS Money Exchange, RMS Money Exchange will ensure that any such transfer protects the legitimate interests of Data Subjects in line with this Policy and applicable local law.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">4.Security: RMS Money Exchange is committed to protecting Personal Data against unauthorized use or disclosure. To ensure the appropriate use of Personal Data, and prevent unauthorized access to such Personal Data, as well as prevent loss, alteration or destruction of Personal Data.

                <p class="mt-2">5.Data Integrity: RMS Money Exchange will collect and process appropriate Personal Data only to the extent that there is a Business Need for Personal Data, to fulfill operational needs, and/or to comply with legal requirements, including those legal requirements of the countries in which the Personal Data was collected, as applicable. RMS Money Exchange will take reasonable steps to ensure that all Personal Data is relevant, accurate, complete, current, and reliable for its intended use. All Data Subjects have a responsibility to assist RMS Money Exchange in this effort.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">6.Data Retention: RMS Money Exchange will not keep Personal Data for longer than is necessary for the purpose or purposes, for which it was intended, or as required by contractual agreement, by law or regulation, by other RMS Money Exchange policies or, where applicable, for the appropriate statute of limitations period.</p>

                <h4>Transferring Your Data Outside The "EEA"</h4>
                <p class="mt-2">We may transfer your data outside the European Economic Area (the "EEA").</p>
                <p class="mt-2">Some of those countries have a European Commission adequacy decision, which means they are considered to offer an adequate level of data protection.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">Other countries do not have the same level of legal protection as countries in the EEA, or with an adequacy decision. If we do transfer your data in this way, we will take steps to ensure that it is protected to the same levels that apply in the EEA. This may include, for example, ensuring that the organisation receiving the data is registered with the EU-US Privacy Shield (in the case of transfers to the USA), or that we use the EU's model contractual clauses.   </p>
                <h4>Covered Entities</h4>
                <p class="mt-2">RMS Money Exchange entities and all non- RMS Money Exchange entities (e.g., agents, contractors, outsource service providers and processors) accessing or processing Personal Data are required to comply with this Policy with respect to such Personal Data.</p>
                <h4>Responsibilities</h4>
                <p class="mt-2">The Data Officer is primarily responsible for adopting, implementing, and maintaining this Policy.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">The responsibility for the implementation of the Policy lies with every employee and manager, whether the Personal Data is in the form of manual records, computer data or arises from communication with employees and Data Subjects both online (electronic) or off line (manual records). Implementation requirements will include the development of notice and consent forms to provide to managers and Data Subjects where required by applicable laws.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">Employees, agents, contractors and their employees are individually responsible for providing/maintaining accurate information and for protecting the personal information that RMS Money Exchange has about any individual in support of the implementation of this Policy. Employees who violate this Policy or applicable legal requirements are subject to discipline, up to and including termination of employment, dependent on the severity of the violation. Agents or contractors or their employees who violate this Policy or applicable legal requirements are subject to termination and/or other contractual penalties. Employees, agents and contractors should also be aware that if they knowingly or recklessly obtain or divulge Personal Data without RMS Money Exchange consent, they may be committing a criminal offence.</p>
                <h4>Data Privacy Investigation & Dispute Resolution</h4>
                <p class="mt-2">Human Resources will address any complaints or disputes regarding Personal Data promptly and courteously, and will follow all applicable laws to respond to the complaint. This includes inquiries from Data Subjects, employee councils, management sponsors, or regulatory authorities.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">A responsible person designated by management will handle investigations regarding non-compliance with this Policy. All investigations will be handled under the legal requirements of the geographic area where the investigation is taking place.</p>
                <h4>Access To Personal Data</h4>
                <p class="mt-2">The Data Officer is responsible for maintaining and safeguarding Personal Data, and for ensuring that access to such Personal Data is restricted to persons who have a job-related "need to know" or who have documented access rights. Covered entities may have access to Personal Data on a business related need to know for purposes generally compatible with the collection of the Personal Data.</p>
