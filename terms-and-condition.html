                                        procedures with our partners differ in length and complexity, as well as often require communication across time zones.</li>
                                    <li> Refunds can take up to 7 working days to be processed and this depends as well on the customer's bank processes, which are beyond our control.</li>

                                    <li> If we do not transfer the money to the Recipient in accordance with an order within 45 days after your instructions have been received, provided that you correctly followed our procedures and complied with all our policies,
                                        you may ask for a refund of the money transferred to us and intended for the Recipient.</li>
                                    <li> If the Recipient does not collect the money within 13 months after the date it became available for collection, all rights of cancellation of the order or refund of the money transferred or the Fees shall be deemed to be waived
                                        by you.</li>
                                    <li> Your order expires after 1 month. In case the money has not been collected (in the case of cash transfers) or the order requires a correction, we reserve the right to cancel your order without prior notice to you and to refund
                                        to you the amount that was to be transferred. The refund will not include the Fees paid for the Service, which we will retain.</li>
